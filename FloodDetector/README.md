# Flood Detector

This is the Flood Detector Module of the Extreme-Weather-Event-Detection program. It provides a Segmentation Model for SAR images of VH an VV polarisation. 


Currently, there are two Notebooks: 
- `FloodDetectorPreprocess.ipynb` : This notebook handles the preprocessing of the `Sen1Floods11` Dataset.
- `FloodDetectorTrain.ipynb` : This notebook handles the model design and training. Is is evaluated by using the `Mean Intersection-over-Union` Metric. 

Please have a look at those for getting detailled information about the processing and model.


Below are some random SAR images and performed predictions, respectively.
